# Practice 01: Build a Simple Resume or Biography Page

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to create a basic HTML document structure
- Working with essential HTML elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)
- Understanding semantic HTML and proper document structure
- Using horizontal rules (`<hr>`) to separate content sections
- Adding comments in HTML for better code organization
- Creating a well-structured personal webpage

## üìã Exercise Description

Create a simple HTML resume or biography page for yourself (or a fictional character). This exercise will help you practice the fundamental HTML elements you've learned in the first session.

## üîß Requirements

Your HTML page should include:

1. **Document Structure**
   - Proper `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
   - Complete `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` structure
   - A meaningful `<title>` for your page

2. **Content Sections**
   - **Header**: Your name as the main heading (`<h1>`)
   - **Contact Information**: Email and phone number with bold labels
   - **About Me**: A brief introduction paragraph about yourself
   - **Education**: Your educational background
   - **Skills**: List of your current skills or interests
   - **Hobbies**: Personal interests using italic text for emphasis

3. **HTML Elements to Use**
   - `<h1>` for your main name/title
   - `<h2>` for section headings
   - `<p>` for paragraphs and text content
   - `<strong>` for bold text (like labels)
   - `<em>` for italic text (like hobby names)
   - `<hr>` to separate different sections
   - `<br>` for line breaks within content
   - HTML comments to organize your code

## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create the HTML file**
   - Create a new file called `index.html` or `resume.html`
   - Start with the basic HTML5 document structure

2. **Add the document head**
   - Include a descriptive title for your page
   - The title should reflect the content (e.g., "My Simple Resume")

3. **Build the content sections**
   - Start with your name as the main heading
   - Add contact information with proper formatting
   - Create each section (About, Education, Skills, Hobbies) with appropriate headings
   - Use horizontal rules to visually separate sections

4. **Apply text formatting**
   - Use `<strong>` for labels and important information
   - Use `<em>` for emphasis on specific words
   - Structure your content in readable paragraphs

5. **Add comments**
   - Include at least one HTML comment to explain a section of your code

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Keep it simple**: Focus on content structure rather than styling
- **Be semantic**: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **Stay organized**: Use proper indentation and comments
- **Test your page**: Open it in a web browser to see how it looks
- **Validate your HTML**: Make sure all tags are properly closed

## üé® Example Content Ideas

If you're stuck on what to include, here are some suggestions:

- **Name**: Your real name or a fictional character
- **Contact**: Email address and phone number (can be fictional)
- **About**: Brief introduction about your background and interests
- **Education**: Current school, graduation year, or relevant courses
- **Skills**: Programming languages, tools, or any other abilities
- **Hobbies**: Reading, sports, music, gaming, etc.

## üîç What to Focus On

This is your first HTML exercise, so focus on:
- Understanding how HTML tags work
- Proper nesting of elements
- Creating readable and well-structured code
- Getting comfortable with basic HTML syntax

Remember: The goal is to practice HTML fundamentals, not to create a visually stunning page. Styling will come later with CSS!

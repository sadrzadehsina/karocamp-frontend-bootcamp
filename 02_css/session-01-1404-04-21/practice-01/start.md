# Practice 01: CSS Selectors & Combinators - Element Form Styling

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to use basic CSS selectors (element, class, id)
- Working with grouping selectors
- Understanding descendant and child selectors
- Applying pseudo-classes for interactive states
- Using attribute selectors for form elements

## 📋 Exercise Description

Create a styled contact form using various CSS selectors and combinators. This exercise will help you practice targeting different elements precisely.

## 🔧 Requirements

### HTML Structure
Create an HTML file with:
- A contact form with various input types
- Text inputs, email input, textarea, and submit button
- Use classes and IDs for styling hooks
- Include a navigation list above the form

### CSS Styling Tasks
1. **Basic Selectors**: Style all paragraphs, use class `.highlight` for important text, use ID `#main-form` for the form container
2. **Grouping**: Style h1 and h2 headings with the same color
3. **Descendant Selectors**: Style all inputs inside the form differently
4. **Child Selectors**: Style direct children of the form only
5. **Pseudo-classes**: Add hover effects to buttons and focus states to inputs
6. **Attribute Selectors**: Style `input[type="email"]` differently from `input[type="text"]`

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

- Use a clean, modern color scheme
- Ensure good contrast for accessibility
- Add subtle hover and focus effects
- Make the form visually appealing and functional

## 🚀 Bonus Challenges

- Style the first and last items in a navigation list differently
- Use `:nth-child()` pseudo-class for alternating styles
- Create a custom checkbox or radio button style

## 📝 Expected Output

A well-styled contact form demonstrating mastery of CSS selectors and combinators with interactive states.

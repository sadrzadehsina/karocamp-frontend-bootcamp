## üìã Exercise Description

Create a contact form for a personal website or business. This exercise will help you practice the form elements and input types covered in Stage 5 of Session 3.

## üîß Requirements

### Basic Structure
- Create a proper HTML document with DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags

  - Phone Number (text input)
  - Subject (text input)
  - Message (textarea)
  - Submit button

### Form Features
- Use proper `<label>` elements for each input field
- Set appropriate `name` and `id` attributes for all form controls

## üé® Styling Notes (Optional)
While we haven't covered CSS yet, you can add basic styling using inline styles if you want to make it look better.

## üìù Example Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Contact Us</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Contact Us</h1>
    <p>We'd love to hear from you! Please fill out the form below.</p>
    
    <form action="#" method="POST">
        <!-- Your form fields go here -->
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

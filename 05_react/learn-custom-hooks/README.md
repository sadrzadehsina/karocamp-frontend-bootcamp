# Learn Custom Hooks - Simple Guide for Beginners

This folder contains easy-to-understand practice exercises to learn React Custom Hooks.

## What are Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks are just JavaScript functions that:
- Start with the word "use" (like `useCounter`, `useToggle`)
- Can use other React hooks inside them
- Help you reuse logic between different components
- Make your code cleaner and easier to understand

Think of them as "recipes" that you can use in multiple places!

# Practice 03: useEffect Cleanup

## Goal
Understand how to clean up side effects in `useEffect` (e.g., timers, subscriptions).

## Instructions

1. Create a component that starts a timer when it mounts and displays the elapsed seconds.
2. Use `useEffect` to set up the timer and clean it up when the component unmounts.
3. Add a button to show/hide the timer component to test cleanup.

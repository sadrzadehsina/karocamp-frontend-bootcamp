# Practice 05: Multiple useEffect Hooks

## Goal
Learn how to use multiple `useEffect` hooks in a single component for different concerns.

## Instructions

1. Create a component with two pieces of state: `count` and `theme`.
2. Use one `useEffect` to update the document title when `count` changes.
3. Use another `useEffect` to log a message when `theme` changes.
4. Add buttons to update both `count` and `theme`.

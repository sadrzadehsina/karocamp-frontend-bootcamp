# Practice 01: Basic useEffect

## Goal
Learn how to use `useEffect` to run code after a component mounts.

## Instructions
1. Create a simple React component that displays "Hello, useEffect!".
2. Use `useEffect` to log "Component mounted" to the console when the component first renders.
3. Change the message to "Component updated" when a button is clicked (using state), and log "Component updated" in the effect.

**Questions:**
- When does the effect run?
- How can you control when it runs?

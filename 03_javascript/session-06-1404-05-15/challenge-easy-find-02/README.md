# 🎯 Challenge Easy: Find User by Name (Stage 5 - Arrays .find())

## 📝 Description

Use the `.find()` method to locate a specific user by name in an array of user objects.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice using `.find()` method with objects
- Search by object properties
- Handle found/not found cases

## 📋 Requirements

1. Create an array called `users` with these objects:
   ```javascript
   [
     {id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@email.com"},
     {id: 2, name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@email.com"},
     {id: 3, name: "Mike", email: "mike@email.com"}
   ]
   ```
2. Use `.find()` to search for a user named "Sarah"
3. Store the result in a variable called `foundUser`
4. Display the found user's information or a "not found" message

## 💡 Example Output

```javascript
Looking for user: Sarah
Found user: {id: 2, name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@email.com"}
```

## 🚀 Bonus

- Search by email instead of name
- Search by ID
- Create a reusable search function

## ✅ Expected Topics Used

- `.find()` method with objects
- Object property access
- String comparison
- Conditional display

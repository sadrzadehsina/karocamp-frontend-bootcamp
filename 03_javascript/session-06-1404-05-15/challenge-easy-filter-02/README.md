# 🎯 Challenge Easy: Long Words (Stage 5 - Arrays .filter())

## 📝 Description

Use the `.filter()` method to find words that are longer than a specific length.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice using `.filter()` method with strings
- Use string length property
- Filter based on string criteria

## 📋 Requirements

1. Create an array called `words` with values: `["cat", "elephant", "dog", "hippopotamus", "bird", "butterfly"]`
2. Use `.filter()` to create a new array containing only words longer than 5 characters
3. Store the result in a variable called `longWords`
4. Display both arrays with word counts

## 💡 Example Output

```javascript
Original words: ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "hippopotamus", "bird", "butterfly"] (6 words)
Long words (>5 chars): ["elephant", "hippopotamus", "butterfly"] (3 words)
```

## 🚀 Bonus

- Filter words starting with specific letter
- Filter words by exact length
- Case-insensitive filtering

## ✅ Expected Topics Used

- `.filter()` method
- String `.length` property
- Comparison operators
- Array length property

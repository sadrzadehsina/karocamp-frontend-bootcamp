# 🎯 Challenge Easy: Even Numbers (Stage 5 - Arrays .filter())

## 📝 Description

Use the `.filter()` method to extract only even numbers from an array.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice using `.filter()` method
- Apply conditional logic
- Filter array elements

## 📋 Requirements

1. Create an array called `numbers` with values: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
2. Use `.filter()` to create a new array containing only even numbers
3. Store the result in a variable called `evenNumbers`
4. Display both arrays with their lengths

## 💡 Example Output

```javascript
Original numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (Length: 10)
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] (Length: 5)
```

## 🚀 Bonus

- Filter odd numbers too
- Filter numbers greater than 5
- Combine conditions (even AND greater than 5)

## ✅ Expected Topics Used

- `.filter()` method
- Modulo operator (%)
- Conditional logic
- Array length property

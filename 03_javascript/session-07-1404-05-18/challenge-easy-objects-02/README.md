# 🎯 Challenge Easy: Car Dealership (Stage 5 - Objects)

## 📝 Description

Create a car object and practice various object manipulation techniques including property access, modification, and iteration.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice object creation and property management
- Use different property access methods
- Loop through object properties

## 📋 Requirements

1. Create an object called `car` with these properties:
   - `brand`: "Toyota"
   - `model`: "Camry"
   - `year`: 2020
   - `color`: "Blue"
   - `mileage`: 25000

2. Access and display the brand using dot notation
3. Access and display the year using bracket notation with a variable
4. Add a new property `price` with value 22000
5. Update the mileage to 26000
6. Delete the color property
7. Use `for...in` loop to display all remaining properties
8. Use `Object.keys()` to show all property names

## 💡 Example Output

```javascript
Car Brand: Toyota
Car Year: 2020
After adding price: $22000
Updated mileage: 26000 miles
After removing color...

All car details:
- brand: Toyota
- model: Camry  
- year: 2020
- mileage: 26000
- price: 22000

Property names: ["brand", "model", "year", "mileage", "price"]
```

## 🚀 Bonus

- Add an array property for `features`
- Create a method to calculate car age
- Check if specific properties exist using `hasOwnProperty()`

## ✅ Expected Topics Used

- Object creation and property access
- Dot notation and bracket notation
- Adding, updating, and deleting properties
- `for...in` loop and `Object.keys()`

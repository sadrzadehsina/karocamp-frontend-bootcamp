# 🎯 Challenge Easy 03: Student Grades (Stage 5 - Arrays)

## 📝 Description
Create a simple grade management system using arrays to store and analyze student scores.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice array operations with numbers
- Use array methods like `.push()`, `.slice()`, `.includes()`
- Work with array iteration using `.forEach()`

## 📋 Requirements
1. Create an array called `grades` with these initial scores: [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
2. Add two more grades using `.push()`: 91 and 84
3. Display all grades using `.forEach()`
4. Create a copy of the first 3 grades using `.slice()`
5. Check if grade 96 exists using `.includes()`
6. Find how many students have grades above 90
7. Display the total number of grades

## 💡 Example Output
```
Initial grades: [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
After adding new grades: [85, 92, 78, 96, 88, 91, 84]
All grades:
Grade 1: 85
Grade 2: 92
Grade 3: 78
Grade 4: 96
Grade 5: 88
Grade 6: 91
Grade 7: 84
First 3 grades: [85, 92, 78]
Does grade 96 exist? true
Students with grades above 90: 3
Total number of grades: 7
```

## 🚀 Bonus
- Calculate the average grade
- Find the highest and lowest grades
- Use `.filter()` to get all grades above 85

## ✅ Expected Topics Used
- Array creation with initial values
- `.push()` method
- `.forEach()` method for iteration
- `.slice()` method for copying
- `.includes()` method for searching
- Array length property
